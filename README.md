# BASIC JAVA GUI USING SWING AND AWT

This project contains a very basic JAVA GUI made using JAVA's **Swing** and **AWT**.
Swing is a **GUI widget toolkit** for Java. It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC) â€“ an API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs.
Java AWT (**Abstract Window Toolkit**) is an API to develop GUI or window-based applications in java.

### Some important components of the Project:

- A File Chooser Button
  - uses the JFileChooser class
- Text Panels
- Several other Buttons

###### The ActionListener for all except one (File Choosing Button) are kept empty.

###### For convenience, I've attached a few snapshots of the same in the Images Directory.
